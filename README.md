## What is FindUrFood?

FindUrFood is an intelligent food discovery app that helps you answer the age-old question: *"What should I eat?"*

Whether you're craving something specific, looking for nearby options, or want recommendations based on your mood, FindUrFood has you covered.

## The Problem

We've all been there:
- Scrolling endlessly through delivery apps with decision paralysis
- Standing in front of the fridge with no inspiration
- Wanting to try something new but not knowing where to start
- Having dietary restrictions that make finding food frustrating

## Our Solution

FindUrFood uses AI to understand your cravings, preferences, and context to suggest the perfect meal. Just tell it how you're feeling, and let the magic happen.

## Features

- **Mood-Based Recommendations** - Tell us how you're feeling, we'll tell you what to eat
- **Smart Filters** - Dietary restrictions, budget, cuisine type, and more
- **Location-Aware** - Find options near you or for delivery
- **Learn Your Taste** - Gets smarter with every interaction
